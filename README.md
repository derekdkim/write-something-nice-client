## Introduction

Life is getting more stressful and isolated with the pandemic currently ongoing, and it's still very difficult and sometimes expensive to see a professional therapist. While this isn't meant to fill in that gap, it's always nice to have someone lend an ear without judgement. Write Something Nice is an app where users can reach out for help anonymously and good samaritans can write something nice to give them a hand. The goal of this app is to form just a little tiny bit more of empathy and human connection without the worry of exposing their personal information.

## Usage

### Locally

1. npm install
npm run serve
